This mod will enable the Bonanza to achieve 212 knots (243 mph) at 17,500 ft on cruise power and up to 222 knots (255 mph) on full power! It will climb at 1400 fpm at sea level and has full manifold pressure of 29+ inches all the way up to 18,000 feet. The ceiling is now extended to 25,000 feet

The turbo-aspirated Bonanza vastly increases the climb and cruise performance of the default Bonanza G36 and is based on turbo conversions available in the aviation industry for real Bonanza G36 and A36 owners. It is therefore not a fictional mod but faithfully re-creates the features and power of the turbo conversion.

Included are:

* Re-mapped turbo-powered engine for stunning performance
* Six custom liveries.
* Brighter navigation and strobe lights
* Ambient wing lighting
* Brighter and much longer range landing & taxi lights
* Subtle light reflections on tarmac surfaces
* Re-positioned and re-calibrated interior light for better visibility
* Better suspension and landing gear handling on the ground.
* Adjusted wheel brakes for easier differential brake-turning
* Elimination of twitchy rudder on the ground and take-off run
* Full steering angle at low speeds yet controllable at high speeds
* Rock steady autopilot at normal simulator speed at all altitudes
* Elimination of random twitchy behaviour in non turbulent conditions
* Temp gauges more realistic
* More accurate fuel flow
* Engine changed to 6 cylinders with correct displacement
* Elimination of “baked in” artificial oscillations that are not weather related
* Elimination of artificial movement not related to landscape or air mass
* Harmonised and balanced controls with no pitch bobbing up and down
* Accurate aileron authority and roll rates at all airspeeds
* Proper spins rather than the default spiral dive
* Full side slip capability with up to 33 degrees slip angle
* Correct climb rates and cruise speeds for the turbo version
* A complete overhaul of flight dynamics
* Compatible with Working-Title's G1000 mod

How to install this mod :

Please read the included PDF or RTF for
full instructions & detailed, illustrated guide.


Using this mod will convert the default FS2020 Bonanza G36 into a turbo-aspirated aircraft with much higher climb rates and cruise speeds than the default aircraft. Included are also five custom liveries.

To install, extract the “Bonanza-Turbo-V1” folder of the zip file into your FS2020 packages\community folder.

then simply remove this mod from your community folder.

This mod took over 150 hours to make. It is a free mod, but donations are very welcome
and this helps me to spend more energy and time devoted to improving it and also creating
more mods for flight simulator MSFS2020. Any donation will be sincerely appreciated. Thank you.
